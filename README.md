# coding-quiz

## Description

A quiz app that is a race against time to try and answer all the questions before time runs out, when time runs out you can save your initials to a high-score page. Brought it as far as i could take it with my current skill level but I have learned a lot about how I would and would not do things the next time around. Will definitely complete this at some point.
